* _Tusk Art Space Discovery Project_

Like most of my ideas this one struck out of the blue. The basic concept
has been lingering deep down but I've never articulated it. I had been watching
a show called CHH Heroes about normal people who do amazing things to help some
aspect of mankind. This inspired me and then it exploded.

There are so many artists and photographers in Australia who are
incredibly talented who will never have their work shown in a commercial
gallery. I get e-mails almost every day from artists all around Australia and
further afield submitting their work to me. Sometimes I can see potential but
at the same time they have a way to go before they are ready to exhibit.
Sometimes I get a submission from an artist who excites me but then I also know
that I'm going to have a hell of a time selling their work and then every now
and again I get a submission from an artist who ticks all the boxes. This still
leaves literally hundreds, if not thousands of artists who will continue to
create their art but not get the exposure that they need to move their career
forward.

_Running A Commercial Gallery_

The overheads are huge. For example, our rent at our Camberwell Gallery
alone is over $4000 every week. Then there are all the other costs...wages,
insurance, power and on the list goes.

We have to get the mix right in order to sell enough art each week to
just make the ends meet. It is very rewarding but also very stressful at the
same time. A couple of bad weeks can throw you into a pit of debt and despair that
is hard to get out of.

To this extent we can't get too experimental with what we are
exhibiting. We know our demographic and we have to cater to it. This is not a
compromise, it is a fact of life.

Please keep in mind that there are not that many commercial art
galleries in Australia who are financially viable and selling a lot of original
art.

_How To Support More Artists_

This is where my idea might help. In order to do this we need a no risk
financial situation where the potential to exhibit, market and sell a wide
range of art is not going to cause a mental and financial breakdown.

Imagine having a space where up to 50 artists a year could exhibit their
work with the potential of kick starting a career as a professional artist.
Imagine having a non-profit organization whose singular purpose is to choose
these 50 artists a year and get behind them with marketing, social media, press
releases, curating skills, exhibitions, a website and a sales team to sell
their work.

This could come into existence if I can convince enough people to
support art and artists.

_The Basics_

Crowd Funding : We
would need about $500,000 a year to make an impact. This could be as simple as
1000 people committing to a $10 donation each week. $500 a year which equates
to approx. 2.5 good coffees a week for 1000 people who want to support art in
Australia.

Exchange : You
would be part of a special "club" who would get priority invitations to
exhibition openings and also you would get a 25% discount on any art exhibited
on the opening nights. If you live interstate we would send you a pre-opening
catalogue so you could choose. You could recoup your $500 yearly fee simply by
purchasing a piece of art valued at $2000\.

An Exhibition Space
and Offices : 

We would need to lease a large exhibition space which had some offices
and work spaces. Ideally we would find a space that is not in incredibly high
rent areas like Camberwell and South Yarra. Bonds can be a problem as well.
We've just had to do a $44,000 bank guarantee for the Camberwell bond (the
extension). Hard to believe but that's the way commercial real estate works
now. It sucks but it's a reality. I'm sure we could find a good space in a
great area.

Staff 

: We would hire a
full time manager who would be overall responsible for the viability and day to
day running of the project. The manager would also be responsible for running
internships with people who have completed arts degrees who need a first step
into the world of art.

Submissions 

: We would call for
submissions for a 12 month program of one group exhibition featuring 4 artists,
sculptors and/or photographers for each of the months of the year. This will
mean that around 50 artists will be exhibited each year.

______

These are the bare bones of my idea. It will rely firstly on whether we
can get 1000 courageous benefactors committing to $500 a year up front which
will be placed in a special bank account and used to finance the operation. Any
profits will go back into the project with the potential to invest in the
project on an Australia wide basis. The second target would be an exhibition
space in Sydney, then Brisbane etc, etc.
